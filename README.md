# Description

Encryptorizer is a client-side encryption app which takes a message and
password and provides a link which can be given along with the password to
someone else. As long as the other person knows the password used for the
encryption algorithm, they can decrypt it with the same app.

Using this mechanism is helpful because it avoids exposing any secret
information to a web server.
